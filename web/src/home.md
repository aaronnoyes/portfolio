## About Me
I am a software developer who studied computer science specializing in networks and security. In my free time, I love to learn about computer security concepts and keep up to date with the latest information. I also develop software in my free time, like this website!

This site is the result of a learning project where I set out to learn about building and deploying modern web applications. The tech stack here is meant to use popular tools and frameworks arranged into a microservice architecture. Here is a rundown of the stack:
- React for the frontend
- .NET API
- AWS Cognito for admin authentication
- Microsoft SQL Server database
- nginx as a reverse proxy
- Docker compose to arrange all of the services
- AWS EC2 to host everything

I plan on writing a post that details how everything was built. In the future, I want to use this site as a place to post about software and security that I find interesting.
